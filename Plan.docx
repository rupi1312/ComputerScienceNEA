This is the plan for my NEA, this is not definite yet (could be in the future).

A website?
    with a database.

A program?
    - could incorporate machine learning and AI
    - could be a game using Unity
    - Backend and Frontend Focus


What to focus upon? (ADD TO THIS)
    - END USERS!!!!
    - COMPLEXITY
    - THE PROCESS OF EACH AND EVERY SINGLE THING YOU DO (functions / procedures /)

ideas that i can probably use:
    - a problem that the school faces (C++, python.)
    - a program for my own use to make life easier? a scrape (get data and files using certain APIs) program for certain files.
        - a website alternative for mobile and windows (this will need HTML CSS AND JAVASCRIPT)
